# A Religion for the Rest of Us

## Our origins

We have **faith** that:

* The god described in Abrahamic texts does not exist.
* There is no omnipotent, omniscient, anthropic, paternal entity that concerns itself with the details of human behavior and human civilization.
* What initiated the creation of our universe is currently unknown.
* If a conscious entity created our universe, then that entity is probably uncaring of humanity because we are beneath its notice.
* If an omniscient entity exists, it is probably malevolent towards humanity.

## Duties

* The best actions we humans – as infinitesimal creatures in a vast hostile existence – can do is to help and care for each other.
* Donate time and money to secular charities as we can.
* Try to do random acts of kindness once in a while.

## Autonomy

* A person's mind and body is their own.
* A person is not the property of civilization.
* A person has the right to do with their mind and body as they will.
    * This includes life inside of a person's body.
    * Bodily autonomy is higher priority than the right to life.
* The only valid purpose of civilization is to enhance the quality of life of its members.
* A civilization which unjustly exploits its members should change.
    * If it fails to change, it should be destroyed, either from within or without.
* If a civilization wishes to grow it should work to create a life worth living for all its members instead of enforcing draconian measures to perpeturate itself.

## Other Religions

We have **faith** that:

* Members of other religions are lying when they say they believe in their gods and myths and miracles.
    * They will refuse to acknoledge this lie.
    * Some wish that they truly beleived but they do not.
    * Living this lie inlfuences their entire worldview. 
    * Others are deceviers using the religious group as a survival tactic.
    * Some get ecstatic or erotic pleasure from living the lie of being devout.
    * Some feel trapped by fear of social isolation.
    * All are willing to perform atrocities for the social benefits provided by the group.
    * Living this 
* Leaders of other religions are diabolical manipulators.
    * They crave their position for wealth or ecstatic/erotic pleasure.
    * D/s relationships are fine among consenting adults, but religious leaders thrill in the deception and nonconsenualtity.
* We must be cautious with people of other religions because they are delusional and guided by villains.
* Any good acts performed by members of other religious is a trick to bring in more members.
