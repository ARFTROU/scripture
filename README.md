# A Religion for the Rest of Us

## Creation

We have **faith** that:

* The god described in Abrahamic texts does not exist.
* There is no omnipotent, omniscient, anthropic, paternal entity that concerns itself with the details of human behavior and human civilization.
* What initiated the creation of our universe is currently unknown.
* If a conscious entity created our universe, then that entity is probably uncaring of humanity because we are beneath its notice.
* If an omniscient entity exists, it is probably malevolent towards humanity.

## Duties

* The best actions we humans – as infinitesimal creatures in a vast hostile existence – can do is to help and care for each other.
* Donate time and money to secular charities as we can.
* Try to do random acts of kindness once in a while.

## Autonomy

* A person's mind and body is their own.
* A person is not the property of civilization.
* A person has the right to do with their mind and body as they will.
    * This includes life inside of a person's body.
    * Bodily autonomy is higher priority than the right to life.
* The only valid purpose of civilization is to enhance the quality of life of its members.
* A civilization which unjustly exploits its members should change.
    * If it fails to change, it should be destroyed, either from within or without.
* If a civilization wishes to grow it should work to create a life worth living for all its members instead of enforcing draconian measures to perpeturate itself.

## Other Religions

We have **faith** that:

* Members of other religions are lying when they say they believe in their gods and myths and miracles.
    * They will refuse to acknoledge this lie.
    * Some wish that they truly beleived but they do not.
    * Living this lie inlfuences their entire worldview. 
    * Others are deceviers using the religious group as a survival tactic.
    * Some get ecstatic or erotic pleasure from living the lie of being devout.
    * Some feel trapped by fear of social isolation.
    * All are willing to perform atrocities for the social benefits provided by the group.
    * Living this 
* Leaders of other religions are diabolical manipulators.
    * They crave their position for wealth or ecstatic/erotic pleasure.
    * D/s relationships are fine among consenting adults, but religious leaders thrill in the deception and nonconsenualtity.
* We must be cautious with people of other religions because they are delusional and guided by villains.
    * Imagine you time travelled to 1585 in Germany and the people there saw your iPhone and strange clothes. You would be burned to death as a witch. Any modern person who claims religious belief other than ARFTROU is capable of the same level of irrational behavior as a superstitious mediavel peasant.
* Any good acts performed by members of other religious is a trick to bring in more members.

## Proselytizing

* Sure, go head and tell others about this religion if you feel like it.
* If you don't help spread the word, one day, you might be the last one left of our beliefs in all of civilization and you'd be surrounded by crazy nuts from all the other religions.

## Legal

* Some nations give special treatment to religios beliefs.
* ARFTROU is a true religion in the legal sense of those nations.
* If you are uncomfortable claiming to have faith in something that in your heart you are not sure of, just say out loud to legal authorities that you believe it anyway. This is important for legal reasons. This lying what every other religious person is doing. They are lying about their beliefs to gain some perceived advantage.
