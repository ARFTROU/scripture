# A Religion for the Rest of Us

We have **faith** that:

* The god described in Abrahamic texts does **not** exist.
    * There is no omnipotent, omniscient, anthropomorphic, paternal entity that is concerned with the details of human behavior.
* What initiated the creation of our universe is unknown.
* If an omnipotent omniscient entity did create our universe, then that entity is uncaring or malevolant.
* The best actions we humans, as powerless infinitesimal entitity in vast hostile existence, can do is to help each other.
